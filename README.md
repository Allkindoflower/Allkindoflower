# Hi, I'm Uğur 👋

I’m a self-taught Python developer from Turkey, focused on building web apps, productivity tools, and data-driven projects. My goal is to create practical software that improves daily life while sharpening my skills as a developer.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
I like to build practical apps that solve real problems while helping me explore new areas of development — from working with APIs, to gamified interfaces, to lightweight data tracking.

### [ISS Tracker](https://github.com/Allkindoflower/isstracker)
A FastAPI web app that shows the real-time position of the International Space Station and identifies the country or ocean beneath it.  
- Built to practice external API handling and geospatial data processing.  
- Uses GeoPandas + Shapely to determine land/ocean boundaries.  
- Provides REST API endpoints with live ISS coordinates.  
- Deployed Demo: https://isstracker-upgl.onrender.com  

Tech: Python, FastAPI, GeoPandas, Shapely, Folium

### [Task Manager](https://github.com/Allkindoflower/task-manager)  
A full-stack gamified task manager where tasks are treated as “quests” instead of to-dos.  

- Designed to explore how UX can make productivity tools more engaging.  
- Add, complete, and delete tasks with a playful “adventure” theme.  
- Includes tests with pytest and Docker support for development.  
- Deployed Demo: https://task-manager-7jyz.onrender.com  

Tech: Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Docker, Pytest

### [Mood Logger](https://github.com/Allkindoflower/mood-tracker-web)  
A lightweight web app for tracking moods over time to build self-awareness.  

- Offers a quick, no-frills way to log moods with timestamps.  
- Stores data locally with cookie-based separation.  
- Responsive design with a clean, accessible interface.  
- Future plans: analytics, visualizations, and cloud persistence.
- Deployed Demo: https://mood-tracker-web.onrender.com

Tech: Python, FastAPI, SQLite, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS
